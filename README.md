# Getting Started

Make sure you have [Python (>= 3.10)](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.

Then, in a terminal within the project folder, install dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run MkDocs with `mkdocs serve` or `python -m mkdocs serve`.

Any text editor will work, but VS Code is recommended. A markdown linter ([markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint)) is included in this workspace to help keep things tidy and correctly formatted - it should be recommended when you first open the project folder in VS Code. Use `ctrl`+`shift`+`F` to automatically format the current page.

Changes merged into `main` will deploy to <https://team1540.catlin.edu/docs>.
