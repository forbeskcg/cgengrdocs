# Getting Started

Make sure you have Python (>= 3.8) and PIP installed.

Then in a terminal within the project folder, install dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run MkDocs with `mkdocs serve` or `python -m mkdocs serve`.

Any text editor will work, but VS Code is recommended. A markdown linter is included in this workspace to help keep things tidy and correclty formatted - it should be recommended when you first open the project folder in VS Code. Use `ctrl`+`shift`+`F` to automatically format the current page.
