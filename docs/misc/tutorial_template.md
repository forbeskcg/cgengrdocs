# Tutorial Template

Include an admonition at the top to the *previous* tutorial, if one exists, and what information might be missed if they choose to skip it:

!!! warning "This is Part 2 of a 3-part tutorial"
    This series is sequential. Do not continue unless you have completed the first tutorial.

    - [Part 1](#): Set up stock on the router
    - [Part 2](#): (this page) Create g-code for the router using Fusion
    - [Part 3](#): Transfer and run the file on the router

Tutorials should contain a few key elements:

- **Clear goal and learning objectives.** The learning objectives are two-fold: to teach a very specific skill, and to reinforce overall program goals.
- **A hands-on activity.** Make sure the tutorial includes a tangible outcome, or in the case of software a functional program. The tutorial should not be a wall of text, either. Include images or video along the way.
- **Stick to the script.** Do not wander very far from the above goals, once formulated. It is easy, and distracting, to get into the weeds. Provide additional learning resources is highly encouraged, though!
??? note "Collapsed admonitions such as this..."
    ... are an excellent way to provide sidebars that can easily be ignored.

## Objective

Put in the objectives here, learning or otherwise, as an ordered list:

1. Provide a high-level overview of the CAM process.
2. Teach safe router setup practices.
3. Show the full and complete process to translate 3d models of plate designs into physical parts, to avoid confusion and to function as a reference manual.
4. Make something fun and small!
