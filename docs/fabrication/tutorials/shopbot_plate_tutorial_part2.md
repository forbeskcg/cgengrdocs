# CNC Router Tutorial: Part 2

The [CNC router](../equipment/cnc_router.md) is a fast, 3-dimensional automated machining tool. While CNC routers are geared primarily for machining softer materials like wood or plastics, they are still capable of machining aluminum or steel with the right settings.

    This series is sequential. Do not continue unless you have completed the first half or are familiar with file preparation in Fusion.

    1. [Part 1](shopbot_plate_tutorial_part1.md): Process a CAM file to prepare it for the router.
    2. [Part 2](shopbot_plate_tutorial_part2.md): (this page) Machine a part on the router using our generated `.sbp` files.

## Objective

The goal of this two-part tutorial is to:

1. Provide a high-level overview of the CAM process.
2. Teach safe router setup practices.
3. Show the full and complete process to translate 3d models of plate designs into physical parts, to avoid confusion and to function as a reference manual.
4. Make a part out of aluminum!
