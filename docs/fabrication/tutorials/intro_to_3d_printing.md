# Introduction to 3D Printing

## Objective

3D printers are additive manufacturing machines that build objects layer-by-layer using melted filament. The Bambu Lab P1S is a high-speed, CoreXY printer with an enclosed chamber and AMS support for multi-material printing. It uses G-code instructions generated from 3D models to precisely control the print head and heated bed.

In this tutorial, we will:

- Learn how to prepare a 3D model for printing using Bambu Studio.
- Set up and operate the Bambu Lab P1S safely and efficiently.
- Successfully print a small custom-designed name tag or badge.

## Procedure

### Design Your Name Tag

Design your name tag in Onshape.

We recommend starting from this [example project](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/03d6037b25f260e68733c332/w/bec18e5b73356748df04d15f/e/f3d44ad77acdb351dc18acb9). You can copy it and make modifications—change the shape, add your name, or include a small graphic.

### Install Bambu Studio

Bambu Studio is the slicing software used to prepare 3D models for printing on Bambu Lab printers. It takes in 3D design files (STL, 3MF, etc.), allows you to position, scale, and orient them, and then slices them into printable layers with customizable settings like layer height, infill, support, and temperature. It also offers a preview of the print and sends the job directly to the P1S over the network or via SD card.

To get started, download and install [Bambu Studio](https://bambulab.com/en/download/studio) for your operating system.

### Cleanup

After your print is complete, it's important to leave the 3D printer and workspace clean and ready for the next user. Proper cleanup not only extends the life of the equipment, but also ensures safety and smooth operation for everyone.

1. Remove your finished material
    - Carefully take your workpiece off the bed.
    - Be sure to collect any small pieces that may have fallen through or been left behind.
2. Clear leftover scraps and debris
    - Remove any small bits of wood, charred pieces, or dust.
    - Pay special attention to the honeycomb bed — debris stuck here can interfere with future cuts or become a fire hazard.
3. Return tools and accessories
    - Put the focusing tool, USB cables, and any other borrowed tools back in their designated spots.
    - If you used tape or magnets to hold down material, return them to the Annex area.

## Takeaway

Congratulations! :tada: You are now ready to make anything you want on the 3D printer.
