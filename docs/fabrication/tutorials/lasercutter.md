# Lasercutter Tutorial

Current Status: `Outlined`

## Objective

Lasercutters are planer gantry machines that use a high power laser to burn through material. Most modern machines are CNC and use software to translate a 2D design into instructions to automatically move a head along an XY gantry.

In this tutorial, we will:

- Learn the process to setup and clean up the [Omtech 100 Watt laser cutter](../equipment/laser_cutter.md) in the Outback.
- Create `something` using `some tools`.
- Do all of the above without burning down the building :fire: or suffocating on toxic fumes :material-smoke:.

## Procedure

### Machine Setup

Find the material you want. In this case, we will use 1/4" Baltic Birch plywood.

Set table height.

### Design Transfer

Export design and import into lightburn

### Software Setup

Install Lightburn.

Get file into Lightburn.

### Connect to Machine

Connect USB cable.

### Verify Cut

Run a preview cut to make sure the laser does not leave the material border.

!!! note
    The small red laser dot is a nominal marker and does **NOT** correspond precisely with the actual invisible IR laser. The *real* laser is perfectly aligned with the lens on the gantry, and may be slightly forward or behind the red dot.

### Go

Hit go, sit back, and relax while the laser cutter does all the hard work!

!!! warning "Never leave the machine unattended!"
    The laser cutter is one of several automated machines that **CAN** malfunction. When some machines malfunction, they just break the part or tool and no harm is done, egos aside. The laser cutter, however, has the potential to catch fire :fire:. There is a dedicated fire extinguisher by the machine. Always be aware of its location before starting a cut, and be prepared to use it. :fire_extinguisher:

### Cleanup

Take material off the bed.

Make sure the bed is level and clear of small debris that might have fallen out.

## Takeaway

Congratulations! :tada: You are now ready to make anything you want on the laser cutter.

Always check the [allowable materials](../equipment/laser_cutter_materials.md) if you are unsure, as some plastics do not cut well or off-gas toxic fumes, such as PVC or polycarbonate
