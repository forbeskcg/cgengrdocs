# 3D Printer

## About

Our 3D printing setup includes a range of FDM printers to suit different materials, part sizes, and print requirements. While we have a Prusa MK4, Fusion3 F410, and Stratasys Dimension 1200es for specialized tasks, we recommend using our Bambu Lab printers—the A1 Mini and P1S—for most prints due to their speed, reliability, and excellent print quality.

This guide will be primarily focused on the Bambu Lab ecosystem, but similar principles hold true for the other platforms.
