# Welcome to Engineering at Catlin Gabel

This website is meant as a reference guide for many of the tools and processes within the Outback lab and shop. While instructive, this is not meant to be a comprehensive source. There are plenty of materials available online for diving deeper into any particular subject, and those are included where possible.

## Site Structure

The site is organized roughly by discipline/department. Pages will come in one of few flavors:

- Theory, such as mechanisms and software engineering practices
- Tutorials, or hands-on learning such as how to create and print an object using OnShape
- Reference pages, such as appropriate materials for use on our laser cutter

Be sure to check out recommendations on higher education, [internship opportunities](misc/internships.md), and more.

Happy creating! :material-safety-goggles: :hammer:
